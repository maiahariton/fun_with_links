1. Create a static page with a link that opens www.google.com in a new window. The page has to use JS to open the link when clicked.

2. Working with the same page. Make the same link 200x200 pixels and give it a background color of your choice and a padding of 20 pixels. DO this without the actual size of link element changing beyond the 200x200 pixels.

3. Finally, working with the same link element. Make the link visually hidden after being clicked without it being inaccessible by screen readers.
